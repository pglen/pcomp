                                SYNTAX

  Syntax of the pcomp source file. This is not meant to be a spec, more like
  a spec draft or an idea starter.

 Overall structure:

	One or more of the following:

		preprocessor statement(s)
		platform statement(s)
        import statement(s)
		debug statement(s)
        comment(s)
        doc comment(s)
        variable declaration(s)
        assignments and declaration(s)
        arithmetic and action statements
        function declaration(s)
        function call(s)

 Comments:

		lines with # as the first non space
		from // to end of line
		from dnl to end of line
		between	/* */

 Doc comments:

		lines with ## as the first non space
		from /// to end of line
        between	/**  */

 Line continuation:

	Lines are continued on the next line if backslash is at the end.
	Trailing spaces? no?

 Platform statement(s):

    The generated code
    platform    name  native / cross

 Import statement(s):

    Import interface from source file or interface file

  Data declarations:

	type varname;
	type varname1, varname2 .... varnameN;
	type varname = exp;

	Types:

		u8; u16; u32; 				; Unsigned integers
		s8; s16; s32; 				; Signed integers

		single,	double, quad		; Floating point types

        pointer                     ; Pointer to data

	Custom types:

		type_name					; declared by struct statement

 Data attributes:

        constant volatile static external register

 Data initialization:

	type decl;
	type decl = const;
	type decl = val;
	type decl = const expr;
	type decl = expr;

 Constant Strings:

  	Between " and " or between ' and ';

  	Escape characters:

		\r \n \a \t \" \' \? \b \\ \v \f \e

        \xXX \DD \oOO \bBBB   \uUUUU
        hex   dec  oct  bin   unicode

  Aggregate:

	struct	{
		type1 element1;
		type2 element2;
		type3 element3;
	   }  type_name;

    array  {
           type : dimention
           } array_name;


    Struct access:

    type_name struct_name;

    struct_name.element1
    struct_name.element2
           .....

    Pointer access:
        *struct_name

    Pointer production:
        &struct_name

    Member access:

  Functions:

	funct funcname { funcbody }

	funct funcname ( arg declarelist ) { funcbody }

		arg declerelist:
		    type1 var, type2 var ...

        // ?? TODO ??
		//max six arguments, loaded into ax bx .. si, di
		//	(al->8 bit -- ax->16 bit -- eax->32 bit)

		Stack is not changed by the args. Optional args are not set.

		Function body may contain all elements that are permitted outside of
		function, and the return statement.

		globals are allocated and initialized, uninitialized vars are zeroed
		local variables are assigned on the stack
		expression temporaries are on the stack

		Return value is delivered in rax.  (al, eax, rax); If the function does not
		specify a return a value, zero is returned.

		Because the function calls do not change the stack, functions can
		be called without a prototype. The function itself is responsible
		to restore the stack allocated during execution.

    unit funcname ( arg declarelist ) { funcbody }


 Allocations:

		Memory is allocated in the free store, initialized or uninitialized.

 Exceptions:

		The kill exception terminates the application by default.
		Other exceptions set (increment) the appropriate exception variable,
		(excpt) and return without any action. The long exception code is then
        called by way of stack patching, simiar to the low side of the interrupts.
		It is the application's responsibility to respond to the exception
		condition by checking the variable against a saved value.
		The exception pointer variable is reset, and exception report reset automatically.

 Expressions:

		Expressions are evaluated much like in 'C'. New operators are introduced,
		and the order of precendece follows industrial conventions.
		The operators are obeying the signed / unsigned interpretation
		of variables, in case the oparator sign-nesses are in conflict,
		the compiler reports an error.

 Type conversions:

		Casting not required upwards, to larger storage size. Size promotion
		is automatic.

		(type)	cast to type

	Grouping:

		( .. )	give precedence to expression in braces

	Unary:

        !	   	not bitwise
	 	!!		not logical
		&      	address of
		*		dereference of
		-  		unary minus
		^  		power of
		++		increment (pre only)
		--		decrement (pre only)

    Binary:

		*		multiply
		/ 		divide
		/% 		int divide
		% 		modulus
		+		addition
		-		substration

	Binary Logical:

	 	&&		and
	 	||      or
	 	^^      xor

	Binary Bitwise:

		&       and
		|       or
		^       xor

	Binary bitwise operators:

		>> 	shift right
		<< 	shift left

		<<<  rotate left
		>>>  rotate right

 Conditionals:

		>		larger  (left larger then right)
        <		smaller
		>=		larger equal
        <=		smaller equal
        ==		equal
        !=		not equal

  Assignments:

		=		expr
		=		cond
		=		const

  Conditional elements:

	if(condition)
		{
		}
	elseif(condition2)
		{
		}
	else
		{
		}

 Looping elements:

 	loop
	 	{
        decl;

        enter { decl init }
        leave { decl closure }
        cont  { decl closure }

	 	if(condition)
		 	break level;

        if(condition2)
            continue;
	 	}

  Looping creates an infinite loop, and break conditions need to be tested. Enter
  clause executes on entry; leave clause executes on exit;

 Execution control:

  The goto statement transfers control to the label. Intra function
  goto only;

	label:
	goto label;


Additional language features:

	No duplicate definitions of variables are permitted. This is to
prevent local variables overriding global variables, a common source of errors
in traditional languages. Variables and functions share the same name space, so no
conflicting vars and func names are allowed either.

 	No nested functions.

 Command line:

 ./pcomp [option(s)] file(s)

	The assembler file is generated with the same file name as
	the sorce with the .asm extension.
	The preprocessing file is generated with the same file name as
	the sorce with the .pcc extension.

 Preprocessing:

	Processing is controlled by defined names and ifdef statements.
	The definitions posess an exist / does not exist state.
    The pre processor is executed before every other stage.
    The preprocessor maintains the following vars:

        __file__  __line__  __func__ __platform__ __target__
        __version__
        __code_version__
        __author__
        __copyright__

	%define DEFVAR

    %ifdef  DEFVAR
		 Statement list
    %elifdef  DEFVAR2
		 Statement list2
	%else
		 Statement list3
	%endif

	%macro	MACNAME(arg1, arg2 ... argn)
		 Statement list
	%endmac

	%error    "Message to display"

	%message  "Message to display"


 The notion of multipass items.
