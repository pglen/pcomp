					Syntax of the pcomp source file.

 Overall structure:

	One or more of the following:

		preprocessor statement(s)

		debug statement(s)
        comment(s)
        doc comment(s)
        variable declaration(s)
        assinment declaration(s)
        function declaration(s)

 Comments:

		lines with # as the first non space
		from // to end of line
		between	/* */

 Doc comments:

		lines with ## as the first non space
		from /// to end of line

 Line continuation:

	Lines are continued on the next line if backslash is at the end.
	Trailing spaces?

 Data declareations:

	type varname;
	type varname1, varname2 .... varnameN;
	type varname = exp;

	Types:

		u8; u16; u32; 				; Unsigned integers
		s8; s16; s32; 				; Signed integers

		single,	double				; Floating point types

	Custom types:

		type_name					; declared by struct statement

 Data initialization:

	type decl;
	type decl = const;
	type decl = val;
	type decl = const expr;
	type decl = expr;

 Strings:

  	Between " and ";

  	Escape characters:

		\r \n \" \\ \0xNN \0NN

  Aggregate:

	struct	{
		element1 type1;
		elementN typeN;
	}  struct type_name;

  Functions:

	function funcname { funcbody }

	function funcname ( arg declarelist ) { funcbody }

		arg declerelist:
		    type var, type var ...

		max six arguments, loaded into ax bx .. si, di
			(al->8 bit -- ax->16 bit -- eax->32 bit)

		Stack is not changed by the args. Optional args are not set.

		Function body may contain all elements that are permtted outside of
		function, and the return statement.

		globals are allocated and initialized, uninitialized vars are zeroed
		local variables are assined on the stack
		expression temporaries are on the stack

		Return value is delivered in ax.  (al, eax); If the function does not
		specify a return a value, zero is returned.

		Because the function calls do not change the stack, functions can
		be called without a prototype. The function itself is responsible
		to restore the stack allocated during execution.

 Allocations:

		Memory is allocated in the free store, uninitialized.

 Exceptions:

		The kill exception terminates the application by default.
		Other exceptions set (increment) the appropriate exception variable,
		(excpt) and return without any action.
		It is the application's responsibility to respond to the exception
		condition by checking the variable against a saved value.
		The exception variable is not reset automatically.

 Expressions:

		Expressions are evaluated much like in 'C'. New operators are introduced,
		and the order of precendece follows industrial conventions.
		The operators are obeying the signed / unsigned interpretation
		of variables, in case the oparator sign-nesses are in conflict,
		the compiler reports an error.

 Type conversions:

		Casting not required upwards, to larger storage size. Size promotion
		is automatic.

		(type)	cast to type

	Grouping:

		( .. )	give precedence to expression in braces

	Unary:

        !	   	not bitwise
	 	!!		not logical
		&      	address of
		*		dereference of
		-  		unary minus
		^  		power of
		++		increment (pre only)
		--		decrement (pre only)

    Binary:

		*		multiply
		/ 		divide
		% 		modulus
		+		addition
		-		substration

	Binary Logical:

	 	&&		and
	 	||      or
	 	^^      xor

	Binary Bitwise:

		&       and
		|       or
		^       xor

	Binary bitwise operetors:

		>> 	shift right
		<< 	shift left

		<<<  rotate left
		>>>  rotate right

 Conditionals:

		>		larger  (left larger then right)
        <		smaller
		>=		larger equal
        <=		smaller eaual
        ==		equal
        !=		not equal

  Assinments:

		=		expr
		=		cond
		=		const

  Conditional elements:

	if(condition)
		{
		}
	elseif(condition2)
		{
		}
	else
		{
		}

 Looping elements:

 	loop
	 	{
	 	if(condition)
		 	break;
        if(condition2)
            continue;
	 	}

  Looping creates an infinite loop, and break conditions need to be tested.

 Execution control:

  The goto statement transfers control to the label. Intra function
  goto only;

	label:
	goto label;


Additional language features:

	No duplicate definitions of variables are permitted. This is to
prevent local variables overriding global variables, a common source of errors
in traditional languages. Variables and functions share the same name space, so no
conflicting vars and func names are allowed either.

 	No nested functions.

 Command line:

 ./pcomp [option(s)] file(s)

	The assembler file is generated with the same file name as
	the sorce with the .asm extension.
	The preprocessing file is generated with the same file name as
	the sorce with the .pcc extension.

 Preprocessing:

	Processing is controlled by defined names and ifdef statements.
	The definitions have an exist / not exist state.

	#define DEFVAR

    #ifdef  DEFVAR
		 Statement list
    #elifdef  DEFVAR2
		 Statement list2
	#else
		 Statement list3
	#endif

	#macro	MACNAME(arg1, arg2 ... argn)
		 Statement list
	#endmac

	#error    "Message to display"

	#message  "Message to display"
